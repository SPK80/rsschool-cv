## About me

I have been interested in programming since my student years.

I have worked in a telecommunications corporation for over 16 years.
Having started my career as an engineer in the fiber optic network development department, I faced the problem of a low level of automation of many production processes, and as a result, a huge number of routine and uncomfortable operations.

Using my programming skills, I developed several simple applications and scripts that greatly simplified my and my colleagues' daily work. Some of my applications are popular with many employees of the company.

Throughout the time I was engaged in self-study, and discovered new approaches and tools in programming.
Decided to move into software development.
To begin with, I chose Frontend as a promising and interesting direction for myself.

At the current stage, I am studying the React, Redux, React-Redux.
In the near future I plan to improve my HTML, CSS skills, and delve into TypeScript.
